# flash

## Project Scope
“flash” is a social media application which aims to provide climbers with a platform to share and view videos of rock climbing betas.

## Milestone 1 (Ideation)
### Problem Motivation
For a beginner or even a proficient climber, there will be some routes in rock climbing gyms that are seemingly impossible to complete. Many may find that they hit roadblocks in their rock climbing progression because of the fact that they are unable to figure out the beta* of routes, especially with climbing styles that they are unfamiliar with. Other than scrolling through Instagram for routes that people have posted (which are usually disorganised) and asking for help around the gym, there is almost nowhere else to find climbing betas.

It is always more fun to climb with a big group of friends. However, without a platform such as clubs to find people to climb with, it is almost impossible to find new friends to enrich your climbing experience. Also, there is a high chance that there are many people out there who want to make new climbing friends as well, so why is there no dedicated platform to do so?

### User Stories
- When faced with a rock climbing route that I am unable to complete, I want to be able to search for that route beta quickly.

- As a proficient climber who wants to share my betas with others, I want to be able to have a dedicated platform to do so conveniently.

- As a rock climber who wants to connect with more people in the climbing community, I want to be able to find friends and mentors easily.

- As a rock climber who wants a dedicated space to store my climbing journey, I can do so with this application.

- As an administrator who wants to prevent abuse of the system (e.g. unrelated posts, harassment), I want to be able to warn and ban these users.


### Proposed Core Features
"flash" will consist of a few features including:
- Login / Registration of user
- Homepage
- Search for users
- Filter by gym and difficulty
- Profile page
- Navigation bar
